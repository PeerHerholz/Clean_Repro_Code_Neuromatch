Clean and Reproducible Code - a Neuromatch workshop

Often overlooked but tremendously important: clean and reproducible code is the basis for any type of computational work, no matter if in academia or industry. But what does this actually refer to, what does it entail and what tools can be used to make it easier/ensure quality?

In this short [Neuromatch](https://neuromatch.io/) workshop, we will explore the respective basis, including:

- Code formatting, styling and linting
- Code testing
- Continuous integration

These topics will be explored based on examples, both provided by the organizers and brought by the students. 

The workshop was first held on November 11th-12th 2024.

All materials are published as a [JupyterBook](https://peerherholz.gitlab.io/Clean_Repro_Code_Neuromatch).
