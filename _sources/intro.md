Hello everyone and welcome to the [Neuromatch ](https://neuromatch.io/) [Impact Scholars](https://impact-scholars.neuromatch.io/impact-scholars/intro.html) `Clean and Reproducible Code` workshop!

Within these pages, we provide information on how to follow the workshop, as well as respective materials. This [jupyter book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) will include the used slides and code in a way that they can be explored in an interactive manner. You can navigate through the respective sections via the TOC on the left side and within sections via the TOC on the right side. The three symbols in the top allow to enable full screen mode, link to the underlying [github repository](https://github.com/peerherholz/Clean_Repro_Code_Neuromatch) and allow you to download the contents as a pdf or jupyter notebook respectively. All of this awesomeness (talking about the infrastructure and resource) is possible through the dedicated and second to none work of the [Jupyter community](https://jupyter.org/community), specifically, the [Executable/Jupyter Book](https://executablebooks.org/en/latest/) and [mybinder project](https://mybinder.org/).

## The workshop
  
You can checkout the respective sections:

* [An overview](overview.md)

   What's this workshop about and how is it organized?

* [Setup](setup.md)

   How are things implemented and supposed to work?

* [General outline](overview.md)

   What are the specific topics and aspects taught?

* [Prerequisites](prerequisites.md)

   All things gotta start somewhere and the content of this workshop is of course no exceptions to that, especially since a certain amount of digital literacy, programming, etc. is required. 
   Here, we gathered some resources participants can check out in preparation for the course or just for fun.

* [Code formatting](materials/code_formatting.md)

   How should `code` be formatted to ensure readability and intelligibility?

* [Code testing](materials/code_testing.md)

   How should `code` be tested to ensure functionality?

* [Continuous integration](materials/CI_CD.md)

   How should `code` testing and development be automated?

* [Code of Conduct](CoC.md)

   Necessities for creating an open, fair, safe and inclusive learning
   experience.
