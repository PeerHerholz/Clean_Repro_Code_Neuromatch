However, upon opening it your joy starts to drastically diminish: the entire script, many hundreds of lines long, is basically unintelligable. There are no comments, a fast number of apparently random variables, huge blocks of code, etc. . Long story short: re-using and/or adapting this script will be a lot of work and maybe not even possible.\n",

This includes avoiding the use of `wildcard characters` (`@£$%`) and using `underscores` (“`_`”) to delimit information, and `dashes` (“`-`”) to conjunct information or spaces. They also suggest `dating` or `numbering files` and avoiding words like `FINAL` (or `FINAL-FINAL`). Does any of those things sound familiar? \n",

Fortunately the `Elements of Style` no longer ‘requires’ an unfair emphasis on masculine pronouns. Whereas `inline comments` should be used sparingly, keeping `clear` and `concise comments` not only allows you to keep track of the decisions you have made, what particular `functions` do, and what `variables` are used, it also allows other people to see your thought processes. The `syntax` for `comments` varies with programming languages.\n",
