    "In the prior sessions, we explored and tried quite a few things, from `formatting` and `linting` to running various `tests`. As mentioned before, you should adhere to this principles and utilize the respective resources continuously and whenever you work on your `code`/`analyses`. However, this can of course become cumbersome with more complex `code`. So, ideally we could `automate` the `continuous` checks and quality control. But how?\n",
    "\n",
    "`Continuous integration` (`CI`), is basically that: run the `tests` you wrote previously automatically. In a wider sense, `CI` is the practice of integrating changes to a project made by individuals into a `main`, shared version frequently (usually multiple times per day). This is, because if you work collaboratively on `GitHub` (or `GitLab`) you probably work on your own `branch` or on a `feature branch` but eventually all work comes together in the `main` branch. The `main` branch is also the `branch` on which the \"software package\" or `code`/`analyses` in the end will be built and/or distributed from. So it is very important that everything coming together to the `main` branch is `clean` and `tested`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`CI` software is also typically used to identify any `conflicts` and `bugs` that are introduced by changes, so they are found and fixed early, minimizing the effort required to do so. Running `CI` regularly also saves humans from needing to do it manually. \n",

    "## `CI` on `GitHub`\n",
    "\n",
    "`GitHub` is only one provider of many which let's you automate your `tests` whenever you `push` a new version to the `remote repository`. As `GitHub` is a collaborative `code` platform, it will do this for every `developer` when they push to the `main` branch by default (except if changed respectively). However, you can also use `CI` to test different `branches`. \n",
    "\n",
    "### `GitHub actions`\n",
    "\n",
    "`GitHub Actions` is a `continuous integration` and `continuous deployment` (`CI`/`CD`) service. It allows to automate `workflows` for `building`, `testing`, and `deploying code` directly from `GitHub repositories`. With `GitHub Actions`, you can create `workflows` that run `automatically` on `events` like `pushes`, `pull requests`, or scheduled times.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key concepts and aspects\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Workflow`: A `YAML` file that defines automated processes (like `CI`/`CD`) for your `project`. `Workflows` are stored in the `.github/workflows/` directory within your `repository`. Each `workflow` can have multiple `jobs` and `steps`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `Job`: A set of steps that run on the same `virtual machine` (or `runner`). `Jobs` are executed in parallel by default but can also depend on each other. For example, a `CI workflow` might have separate `jobs` for `linting`, `testing`, and `deployment`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `Step`: A single `task` within a `job`. Each `step` can `run commands`, `install dependencies`, `set up environments`, or use `actions` (predefined reusable commands).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `Runner`: A `virtual machine` hosted by `GitHub` (or self-hosted by you) that runs the `jobs`. `GitHub`-hosted `runners` come pre-configured with different `operating systems` and tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `Events`: `Trigger points` that start a `workflow`. Common `events` include:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `push`: Runs the `workflow` when `code` is `pushed` to a specified `branch`.\n",
    "    - `pull_request`: Runs the `workflow` when a `pull request` is created or updated.\n",
    "    - `schedule`: Runs the `workflow` at specified `intervals`, like a cron job.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. `Actions`: Predefined or custom `scripts` that perform `tasks` within a `step`. `GitHub` provides many `actions` (like `checkout` for `cloning` the `repository`) that you can reuse in your `workflows`.\n"
